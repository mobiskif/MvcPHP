<section><h2>Apache module</h2>

   <p class="simpara">
    When <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> is used as an Apache module it inherits Apache&#039;s user
    permissions (typically those of the &quot;nobody&quot; user). This has several
    impacts on security and authorization. For example, if you are using
    <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> to access a database, unless that database has built-in access
    control, you will have to make the database accessible to the
    &quot;nobody&quot; user. This means a malicious script could access and modify
    the database, even without a username and password. It&#039;s entirely
    possible that a web spider could stumble across a database
    administrator&#039;s web page, and drop all of your databases.
